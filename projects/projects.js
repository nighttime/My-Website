        body: `Adulting101.how is a personal finance resource for millenials. I launched the site as a bridge to help young adults, who may only have heard about savings accounts, credit scores, loans, and interest, to cross that gap into real knowledge so they can make informed decisions.
        I believe we can do more to help those without strong financial guidance to become successful and empowered adults. I do detailed research on each topic and synthesize it in a friendly way to best communicate with my novice audience.

        body: `Lightning Notes is a note-taking web app. It understands the way you take notes, styling and structuring text as you type.
        You define styling rules, which can affect anything from a single keyword to complex patterns in your text. Lightning structures your document so it's ready to go, right away.
        I developed the product idea for Lightning, led interface design efforts, and engineered the text comprehension engine, which dynamically compiles user rules into regexes.

        body: `For this collaborative art project, I was inspired by vegetation and natural growth.
        I wanted to explore organic motion dictated entirely by computation. Every aspect of the scene is generated probabilistically, which means that each tree is unique.
        The leaves were painted and scanned by my partner. I conceived the concept and programmed the scene in Processing, carefully tuning and easing by hand to achieve motion that truly feels alive.

Echo is an experiment in meme propagation. It models the way an idea spreads through people using one-way messages.
It starts when a user shares a thought. Another user around the world reads it, and if they share it, it's read by another user, and another, and another, until someone breaks the chain. Then no one will see the message again.
Echo is an iOS project with a web companion. I conceived the idea, directed project-wide style, and engineered the mobile client.`
