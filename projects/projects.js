        body: `A topographical contour map models a region's geography by demarcating elevation. I was inspired by these maps: how they form organic shapes, yet still obey a set of rules and are thus interpretable. Here I interpret abstract form through imaginary motion.
        This project was brought to life with Processing and a custom OpenGL shader. It is modeled using randomly generated bivariate Gaussian functions that roam across an imaginary map. The geography has equal height along each contour line. The closer the lines, the steeper the incline.

        body: `For this collaborative art project, I was inspired by vegetation and natural growth.
        I wanted to explore randomized, organic motion. Every aspect of the scene is generated probabilistically, similar to an L-system, which means that each tree is structured but unique.
        The leaves were hand-painted and scanned by my partner, and the scene is programmed in Processing.

        You define styling rules, which can affect anything from a single keyword to complex patterns in your text. Lightning structures your document so it's ready to go, right away.
        Lightning is powered by a text comprehension engine which dynamically compiles user-defined rules into regexes used for styling text as you type.

// Echo is an experiment in meme propagation. It models the way an idea spreads through people using one-way messages.
// It starts when a user shares a thought. Another user around the world reads it, and if they share it, it's read by another user, and another, and another, until someone breaks the chain. Then no one will see the message again.
// Echo is an iOS project with a web companion. I conceived the idea, directed project-wide style, and engineered the mobile client.`
