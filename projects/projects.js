        body: `Lightning Notes is a note-taking web app. It understands the way you take notes, styling and structuring text as you type.
        You define styling rules, which can affect anything from a single keyword to complex patterns in your text. Lightning structures your document so it's ready to go, right away.
        I developed the product idea for Lightning, led interface design efforts, and engineered the text comprehension engine, which dynamically compiles user rules into regexes.

        body: `This project stemmed from a creative block. I had been working on schoolwork for way too long without a creative outlet, and it was awful.
        One day my mind wandered off into the wilds of the internet, and I decided to follow it.
        What I found was a constructive way to get my brain moving again. Now when I'm feeling stifled, I pick an animal and illustrate it.`

        body: `2048: Two to Infinity began with a simple mission: to redo 2048 with <em>class</em> (since the original 2048 cloned Threes! and added insult to injury by using a clunky interface with limited features).
        I built this iOS game from the ground up to be fresh, charming, and engaging. It includes achievements, unlockable themes, leaderboards, and limitless play. I hope you enjoy it :)
        To date, Two to Infinity has over 10k downloads. You can <a class="contact-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DarccjOP6zE">watch</a> the trailer and <a class="contact-link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beyond-2048-two-to-infinity!/id860372644?mt=8">play</a> it yourself.`

        body: `What makes a shareable idea?
Echo is an experiment in meme propagation. It models the way an idea spreads through people using one-way messages.
It starts when a user shares a thought. Another user around the world reads it, and if they share it, it's read by another user, and another, and another, until someone breaks the chain. Then no one will see the message again.
Echo is an iOS project with a web companion. I conceived the idea, directed project-wide style, and engineered the mobile client.`
